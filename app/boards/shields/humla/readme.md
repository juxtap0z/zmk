# Humla keyboard ZMK support

This upload is a conversion for Humla keyboard to support ZMK, specifically for the nicenano v2 and portability.

The original Humla keyboard design and software are the work of 'jmnw' - 'jimmerricks' and can be found at https://github.com/jimmerricks/humla.

Conversion by juxt for my own use, but I wanted to share!
